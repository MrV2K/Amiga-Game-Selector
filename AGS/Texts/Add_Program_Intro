                             Add Program
                             ===========

Welcome to the AGS add program script. This script will add any program to the AGS Launcher.

I've tried to automate the process as much as I can but some knowledge of AmigaDOS is an advantage.

I would suggest that you have the program in it's final location and if you want a preview image,
make sure to have a 320x256 image ready. This image must have a maximum of 128 colours. You can
use ADPro or deluxe paint to edit your image. They are both available in the launch bar on Workbench.

There are several steps that you need to follow to add your program. You can cancel the process at any
time. These are the steps that you will need to take...

1. Enter a name for your program. This can only be 25 characters as the launcher list is limited in width.

2. Select the type of program that you are adding. This can be...

   a. WHDLoad file
   b. Executable file
   c. AmigaDOS script

3. Select the drawer that your program is located.

4. Select the actual file that you are adding.

5. Select an IFF preview image to add.

The script will then generate a generic script that is supported by the AGS launcher. This script is very
similar to the scripts used in other games and demos.

6. You will now get the option to edit the script.

This allows you to set custom emulator settings that are executed before the program is run. This includes
setting the CPU speed, toggling JIT and setting custom hardware settings like blitter modes and NTSC.
To do this all you need to do is uncomment the line in the script. Information on the options are in
the scripts file.

If you need to change these settings after the script has finished; you can edit the script manually
in the 'AGS:+  My Programs.ags' drawer using CygnusEd or the 'Edit' button in Directory Opus. You can also
edit the file by enabling 'Expert Mode' in the launcher and selecting 'Edit Config' from the subsequent
menu.
