All I get is a Kickstart screen when I run AGS on the A500 mini. How do I fix it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You've ignored the important comment at the top of the Readme and broken the 
config file. You will need to copy the original .uae files back. I've included
a script to do this for you called 'Restore Configs'. Just run it from the USB 
screen on the A500 mini carousel and the configs will be restored. You can also
copy them back manually if you want to. The backup configs are stored in a folder
called 'Backup' in the AGS folder on the USB drive.

Whe I run a game, I get DOS-Error #205 (object not found) on reading "devs:kickstarts/kickxxx.xxx"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHDLoad requires kickstart ROM images to run certain games and demos. These files
need to be located in the System:Devs/kickstarts drawer. You can find a list of
the required kickstart images in the needed_kickstarts.txt file in the AGS
installation archive. Amiga kickstart images are still copyrighted so I cannot
distribute them with AGS. If you don't have the kickstart images then Google
is your friend.

Can I use save states on the A500 Mini?
---------------------------------------
Yes and No. The Pandory version of AGS supports save states through the 
Amiberry interface. The standard version of AGS does not support save states as 
the current version of the carousel supplied on the A500 mini doesn't recognize
the custom configuration file and extended memory used by AGS. Therefore it
cannot create a save state. If the game supports saving, it will save to the
'Savegames' folder on the USB drive.

Why do I get HDD block and sector errors when running AGS on the A500 mini.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGS requires a 2.5A to 3A power supply to run properly on the A500 mini. If your
power supply is too low then AGS shows errors. Replace you power supply and
re-run the AGS config.

Why does the power light stay lit on the A500 mini when I power it off after using AGS?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a bug in the carousel that fails to end a task when Amiberry closes if
it has been using a custom configuration. If you have shut down AGS correctly,
you shouldn't have an issue pulling the power cord. It is recommended to invest
in an inline USB-C power switch as this will prevent wear on the USB connector.

Why are my saves not err... saving?
-----------------------------------
Make sure to use the WHDLoad quit key when you exit a game. Check the game's
readme file or the bottom of the blue WHDLoad splash screen to see what that
key is.

Where is the 'PrtScn' or '*' quit key button on the A500 mini virtual keyboard?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several keys not available on the virtual keyboard. Some of theses are
used to quit certain games. If you do not have access to a real keyboard, I have
added the ability to change the WHDLoad quit key. If you go to 'Options' 
then 'WHDLoad', you can set a different quit key which will be used
universally with all games. This option is saved so you don't need to do it
every time you run AGS. You can also change the quit key back to it's default
at any time from the same menu.

Can I shut down AGS without a keyboard?
---------------------------------------
Yes. Go to 'Options' - 'Quit to OS'. This will shutdown AGS correctly.

Can I back-up my saves?
-----------------------
Yes. WHDLoad saves it's games to a folder on the SHARED drive. The folder is 
located in SHARED/Savegames. Copy that folder to your PC and 
your saves are backed up. Some of the WHDLoad games and most of the extra games 
save into their install folder. You would have to manually copy those saves to 
the 'SHARED' drive yourself. I have included Directory Opus 4 for that reason.

Can I use AGS with A500 mini firmware updates?
----------------------------------------------
Yes. AGS isn't affected by firmware updates.

Can I run 'It Came From The Desert' without glitches on the A500 Mini?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

Can I install my own games and programs?
----------------------------------------
Yes. Add the ADF's in the Amiberry interface and install as normal. There is a
tutorial in the help list in AGS.

XXXXXX game still runs too fast. Can I slow it down?
----------------------------------------------------
Yes. There are two things to try...
1. The version of Amiberry on the A500 Mini is quite old and buggy. Most speed
   and graphic errors can be fixed by pressing F12 to open Amiberry and press
   F12 again to close it.
2. Also report it on the thread in the AGS Facebook group and if I can fix it, I
   will add it to my database so the speed will be set automatically in the next
   version of AGS.

What programs are included?
---------------------------
There is a list of included programs in the AGS search list.

Why are some RTG games very slow?
---------------------------------
Run them with the JIT configuration.

Why do the RTG games not fill the screen on the A500 mini?
----------------------------------------------------------
RTG scaling is broken on the standard version. You can use the Pandory version
which has an updated version of Amiberry but runs slightly slower.

On the A500 mini, can I use scanlines?
--------------------------------------
Yes. Enable them in the A500 Mini Options screen under Display options - Enable
CRT effect.

How do I access Workbench?
--------------------------
Press the 'Escape' key when the AGS launcher has loaded.

How do I re-open AGS from Workbench?
------------------------------------
The AGS icon is located in the Workbench menu and on the tool bar at the bottom 
of the Workbench screen.

Can I run the games from the Workbench?
---------------------------------------
Yes. There is a full WHDLoad install on the 'WHD' drives and the extra games are
located on the Games and Extras drives. I have also included IGame which can be
launched from the Workbench menu and the toolbar at the bottom of the Workbench
screen.

Where are my games saved?
-------------------------
Games are saved in a folder called 'Savegames' on the 'SHARED' drive.

Why do the screenshots sometimes disappear on the AGS launcher?
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you run a game or demo whilst the image is fading in or out the image
corrupts or stops loading. This is less of a problem from v1.2 onwards as the
images load a lot faster.

Can I access the Amiberry/WinUAE interface?
-------------------------------------------
Yes. Press the 'F12' key to open the menu and 'ESC' key to close it again. You 
can also access it by opening the '[Options]'  menu in AGS. You can also
access Amiberry/WinUAE from the System Workbench menu.

Can I use two controllers for two player games?
-----------------------------------------------
Yes. Use the Amiberry interface to add/change controllers.

Can I use ADF files in AGS Mini?
--------------------------------
Yes. Use the Amiberry interface to add ADF files. You may need to use the
Amiberry interface to shut down the program as the menu button is disabled.

Will there be updates when new games or WHDLoad updates come out?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I will add an update config file that updates the installs and 
configurations.

The sound runs too slow on Hippoplayer. Can I fix it?
-----------------------------------------------------
Yes. Switch Workbench into AGA mode and Hippoplayer is fine.

Vista Pro and Scenery Generator dont work when I run them. How do I fix them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch Workbench into AGA mode from the menu or with the icons in the drawer.

When I run a premium game, nothing happens. What do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------
The premium games are not supplied with the retail data files. You will need to
source these files and add them to the relevant drawer. Instructions are
included in the help files.
