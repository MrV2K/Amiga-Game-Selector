I've managed to work out a system to add your favourite games and demos to a special list. To do this it
required some special scripting to get it to work. What the script does is add a prompt when you run
a game or demo that asks if you want to add it to the favourites list. If you answer yes, the script copies
the necessary files into the favourites drawer. You can then decide to run the game or demo or go back to the menu.
The removal process is very similar except it doesn't ask to run the game.

Instructions
============

Here's how to add games and demos to the favourites list.

1. Open the '+  Favourites' list
2. Select 'Enable Add Favourite'
3. Go back to the main lists and run the games or demos you want to add.
4. When promped to 'Add to favourites (y/n)?' press 'y' to add the game or demo or press any other key to continue.
5. When you are asked to load the game or demo, press 'y' to load it or any other to go back to the menu.
6. When you are done adding games and demos go back to the '-= Favourites =-' menu.
7. Press 'Disable All Prompts' to get rid of the 'Add to favourite' prompts.

Here's how to remove games and demos from the favourites list.

1. Open the '+  Favourites' list
2. Select 'Enable Remove Favourite'
3. Run the game or demo from the list.
4. When promped to 'Remove from favourites (y/n)?' press 'y' to remove the game or demo or press any other key to continue.
5. Repeat as required.
6. Press 'Disable All Prompts' to get rid of the 'Remove from favourites' prompts.

Troubleshooting
===============

Older versions of the AGS configuration files are not compatible with the new favourites process so cannot be removed
using the game startup option. To remove them you will need to manually remove them with a program like Directory Opus
or remove all your favourites from the favourites menu and start again. 99% of configurations stay the same when AGS is
updated and will continue to run the games. It's only the removal process that is broken.

To remove favourites manually open Directory Opus and navigate to the 'System:AGS2/+  Favourites.ags' drawer. In the
drawer you will see a list of games and some files that are enclosed in square bracket '[]'. Do not delete those as
they are the scripts that run the favourites process. Find the game you want to delete and delete the five files. The
five files should be named xxx.run, xxx.txt, xxx_1.iff, xxx_2.iff & xxx_3.iff.
