                     How to customize Workbench
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial explains how to use the Workbench preference programs to 
customize your Workbench environment. All programs described are accessible from
the Workbench menu or in the System:Preferences drawer.


Setting The Screen Resolution.
==============================

To set the screen resolution use ScreenMode. On the window you will see a list
of resolutions and below a slider for the amount of colours to display. AGS is 
set up as 1920x1080 (1280x720 A500 Mini) using 16 million colours. Changing the
screen resolution or colours will not adversely affect the running of the AGS
launcher or Workbench applications. The only affect is the workbench backdrops
which do not scale and may not fit the screen afterward.

When changing any resolution I advise using the 'Test' button first to check 
that your monitor supports the screenmode. If the screen mode works as you 
expect, then you can save the settings. Once saved, the AGS workbench will
default to your new settings.


Changing the Workbench Backdrop.
================================

To change the Workbench background image use WBPattern. On the window you will 
see a couple of buttons on the left and a pattern maker on the right.

The Placement button determines whether Workbench on the window backdrops are
changed.

The Type button determines whether to use an IFF picture or a hand drawn pattern
for the window of Workbench background. Patterns can be selected from the right
hand tools and can be selected from the presets or hand drawn in the editor box.

The Select Picture button activates if you select Picture from the Type button.
This opens up a file requester for the path with the IFF pictures in it. This
path is in System:Preferences/Presets. Use this list to select a new backdrop.
You need to make sure that the picture is the same size as Workbench or the 
image will be tiled or stretch outside of the Workbench screen.

Use the 'Test' button to preview your selections and to check before saving.
Once saved, the AGS workbench will default to your new settings.


Changing the Font colours.
==========================

It's not recommended to change the actual fonts in AGS as the launcher relies
on the Courier font being installed. Changing this font will break the launcher.
You can however change the font colours without breaking the launcher.

To set the Workbench icon font colours open the Fonts program. If you select
the Workbench Icon Text button you will see a new window with a selection of
colours in it. The Text colours determine the main text colour. The Field button
sets the dropshadow colour. AGS uses NewIcons so does not have a solid 
background for the icon text. Select the colours that you want to use and press
the 'Proceed' button. On the font selection screen I would recommend just
pressing 'OK' and not changing anything.

To save your settings, press the 'Save' button. You can preview your changes by
pressing the 'Use' button. If you just use the 'Use' button, your changes will
be lost when you reboot.


Changing The Workbench Colours.
===============================
To change the Workbench window and menu colours use the Palette program. To
change the colours it's as simple as selecting what you want to change from the
list on the right and picking a colour underneath. You will see a preview of the
changes below.

As with all changes, it's best to use the 'Use' button before hitting the 'Save'
button to make sure that you are happy with your changes.


Changing The Keyboard Country Layout.
=====================================
You can set your keyboard type in the Input program. All you need to do is to
select it from the list on the right hand side of the window and press the save
button.
