         Premium Games Help
         ------------------

Unfortunately most of the premium games
are still available to buy so I haven't 
included the retail data files.

There is a text file in each folder
that tells you which files are needed
and where to install them.

I would suggest dropping them into
the AGS SHARED folder on your PC and
then copying them from the SHARED: drive
in Workbench to the correct drawer.

The easiest way to do this is with
Directory Opus which is on the button
bar at the bottom of the desktop.
