                     How to install a program.
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial explains how to install software from ADF or LHA files.


Installing from ADF files
=========================

1. For Amiberry, copy the ADF files onto your USB drive. It doesn't matter
   where you put them. 

2. Run AGS and wait for it to finish loading.

3. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface. To navigate the options,
   use the cursor keys and 'TAB' key. To select an option, use the 'Enter'
   key. On Raspberry Pi and UAE you can use the mouse.

4. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu. On the screen you will see that
   there are two drives enabled. You can enable more if you want.

5. Select the button with the three dots on it on the DF0: line then press
   enter.

6. On the file screen that comes up, make sure the two dots are highlighted.
   Double click it or press enter to change the folder.

(Raspberry Pi & A500 Mini only)

7. Repeat pressing enter until you see a long list with 'mnt' in it.

8. Use the cursor keys to highlight the 'mnt' folder and press enter. You are
   now looking at the USB drive. Find the first ADF file that you copied earlier
   and press enter. If you have put them in a folder then you just need to
   highlight it and press enter.

(All systems)

9. You should now see the ADF file in the box under the button. If you need to
   use multiple disks, repeat instructions 5 to 8 on the 'DF1' line.

10. To boot from the floppy disk, navigate to the 'Reset' button at the bottom
    of the emulator interface and press 'Enter'. This will reset the Amiga and
    if the disk is bootable, it will load.

11. If you want to access the disk from Workbench, just press the 'F12' button and
    you will go back to the AGS screen. The disk will appear as an icon on the 
    desktop. You should now be able to open the disk image and install the
    software. If the program does not have an installer then you can access the
    disks contents from Directory Opus by pressing the DF0: button on the left
    hand side of the buttons.


Changing the ADF file
=====================
If your software comes on multiple disks then you will need to swap the disk images.

1. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface.

2. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu.

3. Use the cursor keys to highlight the button with the three dots on it
   on the drive line that you want to change and then press enter.

4. On the file screen that comes up, select a new ADF file and press 'Enter'.
   You will now see the new disk in the box below.

5. Press 'F12' to return to the game or AGS and the disk will change.


Ejecting an ADF file
====================

1. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface. To navigate the options,
   use the cursor keys and 'TAB' key. The select an option use the 'Enter'
   key.

2. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu.

3. Use the cursor keys to highlight the 'Eject' button on the disk drive line 
   and then press enter.

4. The disk is now ejected. You can now either reset or resume the Amiga to 
   go back to AGS.


Installing from LHA archives
============================

Most software from the internet is downloaded as LHA archives. These are the
same as ZIP files and need to be extracted for you to access the contents.

1. First you need to copy the LHA files onto the SHARED folder in your AGS
   install. On the Pi you will need to use a program like WinSCP to SSH
   the file onto the Pi drive. For WinUAE and the A500 mini it's as simple
   as dragging and dropping the files into the SHARED folder.

2. Run AGS and wait for it to finish loading.

3. The SHARED folder is called USB: in Workbench. As the files that you
   have copied do not have icons, you won't see them if you just open
   the drive. You need to use one of the included extractor programs to
   extract the contents od the archive.

4a. Directory Opus Method - Run Directory Opus and you will see two lists
    of files. To extract an archive, you need to have the source on one list
    and the destination on the other. The best thing to do is have the USB:
    drive on the left and Ram Disk: on the right. This will stop you
    overwriting important files.

4b. When you have both drives showing then all you need to do is highlight
    the archive that you want to extract and press the 'Archive Extract'
    button. Don't highlight more than one file as Directory Opus will try
    and extract all of them. Also, make sure that the archive names don't
    have any spaces in them as the process will fail.

5a. VoodooX Method - VoodooX is a dedicated archive extractor that supports
    many archive formats. To extract your achive press the 'Open' button
    at the bottom of the window. From the file list select the archive that
    you want to extract and you will see the contents in the main window
    list. You can now either extract selected files or just press 'Extract
    All' to extract the entire archive contents to the Ram Disk: drive.

Notes
=====
Not every drawer in an archive has an icon attached or even uses it's own
drawer so you'll probably still need to use Directory Opus to copy/install
the contents. If there are no icons showing then use 'Show All Files' from
the Workbench menu with the window highlighted. This will show all the
files in the drawer.
