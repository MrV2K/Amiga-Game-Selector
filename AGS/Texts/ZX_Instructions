Frequently Asked Questions.
---------------------------

Q: I pressed start and it just showed the default ZX Spectrum start screen. What do I do?

A1: Possibly the image isn't supported. Try changing the ZX Spectrum type in the top right of the ZX-Live window.
A3: The games included with AGS have been tested. Other games may not work.
A4: Try getting the game in a different image format.


Q: I can't see a game that I added in the load window.

A1: Check that the image type is supported first in the docs.
A2: Check that the filename is not too long and has the correct file extension.


Q: Why are my games playing so slow?

A1: Try AGS JIT mode from the workbench menu as that should speed up the emulator.
A2: Turn off AY sound as that is very CPU intensive.
