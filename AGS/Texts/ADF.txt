                     How to mount an ADF file.
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial explains how to access ADF files and run them from the
Amiberry/WinUAE interface.


Loading and ADF file
====================

1. For Amiberry, copy the ADF files onto your USB drive. It doesn't matter
   where you put them. 

2. Run AGS and wait for it to finish loading.

3. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface. To navigate the options,
   use the cursor keys and 'TAB' key. To select an option, use the 'Enter'
   key. On Raspberry Pi and UAE you can use the mouse.

4. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu. On the screen you will see that
   there are two drives enabled. You can enable more if you want.

5. Select the button with the three dots on it on the DF0: line then press
   enter.

6. On the file screen that comes up, make sure the two dots are highlighted.
   Double click it or press enter to change the folder.

(Raspberry Pi & A500 Mini only)

7. Repeat pressing enter until you see a long list with 'mnt' in it.

8. Use the cursor keys to highlight the 'mnt' folder and press enter. You are
   now looking at the USB drive. Find the first ADF file that you copied earlier
   and press enter. If you have put them in a folder then you just need to
   highlight it and press enter.

(All systems)

9. You should now see the ADF file in the box under the button. If you need to
   use multiple disks, repeat instructions 5 to 8 on the 'DF1' line.

10. To boot from the floppy disk, navigate to the 'Reset' button at the bottom
    of the emulator interface and press 'Enter'. This will reset the Amiga and
    if the disk is bootable, it will load.

11. If you want to access the disk from Workbench, just press the 'F12' button and
    you will go back to the AGS screen. The disk will appear as an icon on the 
    desktop.


Changing the ADF file
=====================

1. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface.

2. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu.

3. Use the cursor keys to highlight the button with the three dots on it
   on the drive line that you want to change and then press enter.

4. On the file screen that comes up, select a new ADF file and press 'Enter'.
   You will now see the new disk in the box below.

5. Press 'F12' to return to the game or AGS and the disk will change.


Ejecting an ADF file
====================

1. Press 'F12' to access the emulator interface. To navigate the options,
   use the cursor keys and 'TAB' key. The select an option use the 'Enter'
   key.

2. Select 'Floppy drives' from the menu.

3. Use the cursor keys to highlight the 'Eject' button on the disk drive line 
   and then press enter.

4. The disk is now ejected. You can now either reset or resume the Amiga to 
   go back to AGS.


NOTES
=====

AGS is set up to be as fast as possible. When you run a game from the AGS menu, it
slows the Amiga down to make the game run correctly. If you run an ADF file, it 
doesn't automatically do this.

To slow down a bit of software...

1. Press 'F12' to open the emulator interface.

2. Navigate to the CPU screen.

3. Select either 7mhz or 14mhz to set the right speed.

4. Press 'F12' to close emulator.
