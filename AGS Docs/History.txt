Fixes / Changes
---------------

Added an automatic update script to user-startup. The process is totally
automatic and removes itself when done.
Removed unneeded configs as they were no longer required.
Stopped the menu button opening the carousel. AGS2 can be closed from the '[System]'
menu in AGS2 and from the Workbench menu. 
All WHDLoad games are up to date as of 27/5/22
Changed the name of the 'Saves' drive to 'USB' as the drawer allows access to 
the USB drive.
Fixed approx 40 games that ran too fast. CPU Speed is now set automatically 
when launched.
Fixed duplicate named games not showing up in the games lists.
Fixed some game names that were too long and didn't show in the lists
Fixed 512k games not showing up in the games lists.
Fixed a couple of games with the wrong genres.
Fixed the Workbench colours corrupting sometimes when a game was loaded.
Fixed horizontal alignment in some games.
Added '[Settings]' menu to AGS which allows the changing of Amiberry settings 
on the fly.
Added '[System]' menu to AGS which allows you to reset and shutdown Amiberry.
Added beta & unreleased games to the year and genre lists.
Added 'Demos by Group' category.
Added WHDLoad readme files for all games and demos.
Added all languages to the 'Non English' list.
Added over 60 new titles that are not part of the WHDLoad database including 
PD, AGA and RTG games. Nearly all the games are accessible in AGS and have 
custom scripts to change the CPU and other settings when run. All the games 
are accessible from the System:Games drawer but the CPU settings will need
to be changed manually.
Added IGame for loading WHDLoad games from Workbench.
Added custom database to IGame with categories and fixed names.
Added aSP, ZX Live, ZX AM and over 300 ZX Spectrum games that can be accessed from 
Workbench. It's recommended you use the JIT config for ZX Spectrum emulation.

Added Final Writer & Wordsworth for word processing.
Added Final Copy for DTP.
Added Deluxe Paint V, Art Department Pro and Brilliance for art.
Added Mand2000 for fun!
Added Turbo Calc and Final Calc for spreadsheets

Added Protracker 2.3F and Octamed Sound Studio for music creation.
Added ST-01 to ST-10 samples disks and a couple of my own mods (they are 
fairly terrible)
Added the shareware version of GoADF for ADF support in Workbench.
Workbench is now 1280x720 in 16 Million Colours with ful RTG support
Added AHI driver for faster sound access.
Added BlazeWCP for faster graphics
Added FBlit to keep chipmem free.
Added icon.library v46 for full colour icons
Added JPEG and PNG datatypes.
Added 8,16 and 256 colour backdrops located in the Prefs/presets drawer. (Only 
recommended on A4000 & JIT settings as they take a while to load on slower 
CPU settings.)
Added NewMode for screen mode promotion.
Added Tools Daemon for quick access to some of the installed programs.
Added Magic Menu for popup menu access.
Added UAE Control program to add ADF files directly into Amiberry from 
Workbench. The files need to be located in the 'USB' drive to be accessible. 
Use the F12 Amiberry menu to remove them if necessary.
Changed all icons to high colour ones.
Changed chipmem to 8mb.
Changed WHDLoad.prefs to disable write caches so games should save immediately 
rather than waiting until you exit the game. I would still recommend using 
the quit key as well. You can see the quit key at the bottom of the splash
screen.
Update WHDLoad to the latest beta (18.8 build 6423) which has mouse, keyboard 
and controller support for the splash screen options.
