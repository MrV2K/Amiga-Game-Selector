Fixes

   when launched.

7. Fixed horizontal alignment in some games.

Additions
---------
1. Added Settings menu to AGS which allows the changing of Amiberry settings
    on the fly.
2. Added System menu to AGS which allows you to reset and shutdown Amiberry.
3. Added beta & unreleased games to the year and genre lists.
4. Added 'Demos by Group' category.
5. Added WHDLoad readme files for all games and demos.
6. Added all languages to the 'Non English' list.
7. Added over 60 new titles that are not part of the WHDLoad database
    including PD, AGA and RTG games. Nearly all the games are accessible in
	AGS and have custom scripts to change the CPU and other settings when run
	. All the games are accessible from the System:Games drawer but the CPU
	settings will need to be changed manually.
8. Added IGame for loading WHDLoad games from Workbench.
9. Added custom database to IGame with categories and fixed names.
10. Added aSP, ZX Live, ZX AM and over 300 ZX Spectrum games that can be
    accessed from Workbench. It's recommended you use the JIT config for ZX
	Spectrum emulation.
11. Added Amos Pro Unity and Ultimate Blitz Basic for programming.
12. Added Final Writer & Wordsworth for word processing.
13. Added Final Copy for DTP.
14. Added Deluxe Paint V, Art Department Pro and Brilliance for art.
15. Added Mand2000 for fun!
16. Added Turbo Calc and Final Calc for spreadsheets
17. Added Final Data for database creation.
18. Added Protracker 2.3F and Octamed Sound Studio for music creation.
19. Added ST-01 to ST-10 samples disks and a couple of my own mods (they are 
    fairly terrible)
20. Added the shareware version of GoADF for ADF support in Workbench.
21. Added BlazeWCP for faster graphics
22. Added FBlit to keep chipmem free.
23. Added icon.library v46 for full colour icons
24. Added JPEG and PNG datatypes.
25. Added 8,16 and 256 colour backdrops located in the Prefs/presets drawer.
    (Only recommended on A4000 & JIT settings as they take a while to load on
26. slower CPU settings.)
27. Added NewMode for screen mode promotion.
28. Added Tools Daemon for quick access to some of the installed programs.
29. Added Magic Menu for popup menu access.
30. Added AHI driver for faster sound access.
31. Added UAE Control program to add ADF files directly into Amiberry from 
    Workbench. The files need to be located in the 'USB' drive to be
	accessible. Use the F12 Amiberry menu to remove them if necessary.
32. Added an automatic update script to user-startup. The process is totally
    automatic and removes itself when done.

Changes
-------
1. Workbench is now 1280x720 in 16 Million Colours with ful RTG support
2. Changed all icons to high colour ones.
3. Changed chipmem to 8mb.
4. Changed WHDLoad.prefs to disable write caches so games should save
   immediately rather than waiting until you exit the game. I would still
   recommend using the quit key as well. You can see the quit key at the
   bottom of the splash screen.
5. Update WHDLoad to the latest beta (18.8 build 6423) which has mouse,
   keyboard and controller support for the splash screen options.
6. Removed unneeded configs as they were no longer required.
7. Stopped the menu button opening the carousel. AGS2 can be closed from the
   '[System]' menu in AGS2 and from the Workbench menu. 
8. All WHDLoad games are up to date as of 27/5/22
9. Changed the name of the 'Saves' drive to 'USB' as the drawer allows access
   to the USB drive.
