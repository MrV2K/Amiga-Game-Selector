General Questions
=================


How do I exit a game?
---------------------
You need to use the WHDLoad quit key to exit a game properly. Check the game's
readme file or the bottom of the blue WHDLoad splash screen to see what that
key is.

Why are my saves not err... saving?
-----------------------------------
Make sure to use the WHDLoad quit key when you exit a game. Check the game's
readme file or the bottom of the blue WHDLoad splash screen to see what that
key is.

Can I quit AGS without a keyboard?
----------------------------------
Yes. Go to 'Options' - 'Quit to OS'. This will shutdown AGS correctly.

Can I back-up my saves?
-----------------------
Yes. WHDLoad saves it's games to a folder on the SHARED drive. The folder is 
located in SHARED/Savegames. Copy that folder to your PC and 
your saves are backed up. Some of the WHDLoad games and most of the extra games 
save into their install folder. You would have to manually copy those saves to 
the 'SHARED' drive yourself. I have included Directory Opus 4 for that reason.

Can I install my own games and programs?
----------------------------------------
Yes. Add the ADF's in the WinUAE/Amiberry interface and install as normal. There
is a tutorial in the 'Documentation - Help' list in the launcher and Workbench
'Help' menu.

Can I add the programs that I have installed to the AGS launcher?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On version 2.6, yes. Enable 'My Programs' in the filter and use the 'Add
Program' option to add the program that you have installed to the launcher.
Make sure to read the instructions before completing an install.

XXXXXX game still runs too fast. Can I slow it down?
----------------------------------------------------
Yes. There are a few things to try...
1. The version of Amiberry on the A500 Mini is quite old and buggy. Most speed
   and graphic errors can be fixed by pressing F12 to open Amiberry and press
   F12 again to close it.
2. Also report it on the thread in the AGS Facebook group and if I can fix it, I
   will add it to my database so the speed will be set automatically in the next
   version of AGS.
3. You can also change a games speed when you run it by enabling 'Expert Mode'.

What programs are included?
---------------------------
There is a list of included programs in the AGS 'Search' list.

Why are some RTG games very slow?
---------------------------------
Run them with the JIT configuration.

How do I access Workbench?
--------------------------
Press the 'Escape' key when the AGS launcher has loaded.

Can I boot straight to Workbench?
---------------------------------
Yes, You can switch the boot sequence in the 'Options' menu on the launcher or
from the 'System' menu in Workbench.

How do I re-open AGS from Workbench?
------------------------------------
AGS is located on the AGS_Drive and in the Workbench menu and on the tool bar
at the bottom of the Workbench screen.

Can I run the games from the Workbench?
---------------------------------------
Yes. There is a full WHDLoad install on the following drives...

'WHD' drives(A500 Mini)
'AGS_Drive' (WinUAE / Raspberry Pi)
'Work:WHDLoad' (AGS Classic)

More games are located on the 'Games' and 'Extras' drives. I have also included
IGame which can be launched from the Workbench menu and the toolbar at the
bottom of the Workbench screen.

Where are my games saved?
-------------------------
Games are saved in a folder called 'Savegames' on the 'SHARED' drive.

Why do the screenshots sometimes disappear on the AGS launcher?
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you run a game or demo whilst the image is fading in or out the image
corrupts or stops loading.

Can I access the Amiberry/WinUAE interface?
-------------------------------------------
Yes. Press the 'F12' key to open the menu and 'ESC' key to close it again. You 
can also access it by opening the '[Options]'  menu in AGS. There is also an 
option to access Amiberry/WinUAE from the 'System' Workbench menu.

Can I use two controllers for two player games?
-----------------------------------------------
Yes. Use the WinUAE/Amiberry interface to add/change controllers. There is a 
youtube video on the EasyEmu youtube channel and a text file in 'Documentation
- Help' in the AGS Launcher

Will there be updates when new games or WHDLoad updates come out?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I will add an update config file that updates the installs and 
configurations.

Vista Pro and Scenery Generator don't work when I run them. How do I fix them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch Workbench into AGA mode from the menu or with the icons in the drawer.

When I run a 'Premium' game, I get an error about missing files. What do I do?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The premium games are not supplied with the retail data files. You will need to
source these files and add them to the relevant drawer. Instructions are
included in the relevant drawers in the 'Extras' drive and AGS will automatically
detect if the data file is missing and will show a 'Required Files' text file.

Can I remove stuff from the AGS launcher?
-----------------------------------------
Yes. There is a 'Filter' list that will remove whole categories from the main
list. You can also remove specific games and demos from the launcher by enabling
'Expert Mode' in the options and running the game that you would like to remove.
You can then remove the game by selecting 'Delete Game'. WARNING! This process
cannot be undone without a full re-install.

Can I make AGS child friendly and permanently remove the 'Adult' categories?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Select 'Delete Adult Categories' in the 'Filter' menu and the script will
remove the games and demos from the AGS launcher and IGame. It will not however
delete the game files from the AGS_Drive.

A500 Mini Questions
===================


All I get is a Kickstart screen when I run AGS on the A500 mini. How do I fix it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You've ignored the important comment at the top of the installation file and broken the 
config file. You will need to copy the original .uae files back. I've included
a script to do this for you called 'Restore_Configs'. Just run it from the USB 
screen on the A500 mini carousel and the configs will be restored. You can also
copy them back manually if you want to. The backup configs are stored in a folder
called 'Backup' in the AGS folder on the USB drive.

The edges of my screen are cut off. How to I fix it?
----------------------------------------------------
This is caused by the 720p screen that AGS uses not working with your default
TV zoom. You need to look in your TV's settings for scan/zoom/overscan settings
or change your HDMI port settings to PC mode.

Why do I get HDD block and sector errors when running AGS on the A500 mini.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGS requires a 2.5A to 3A power supply to run properly on the A500 mini. If your
power supply is too low then AGS shows errors. Replace you power supply and
re-run the AGS config.

Can I use save states on the A500 Mini?
---------------------------------------
Yes and No. The Pandory version of AGS supports save states through the 
Amiberry interface. The standard version of AGS does not support save states as 
the current version of the carousel supplied on the A500 mini doesn't recognize
the custom configuration file and extended memory used by AGS. Therefore it
cannot create a save state. If the game supports saving, it will save to the
'Savegames' folder on the USB drive.

Why does the power light stay lit on the A500 mini when I power it off after using AGS?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a bug in the carousel that fails to end a task when Amiberry closes if
it has been using a custom configuration. If you have shut down AGS correctly,
you shouldn't have an issue pulling the power cord. It is recommended to invest
in an inline USB-C power switch as this will prevent wear on the USB connector.

Where is the 'PrtScn' or '*' quit key button on the A500 mini virtual keyboard?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several keys not available on the virtual keyboard. Some of these are
used to quit certain games. If you do not have access to a real keyboard, I have
added the ability to change the WHDLoad quit key. If you go to 'Options' 
then 'WHDLoad', you can set a different quit key which will be used
universally with all games. This option is saved so you don't need to do it
every time you run AGS. You can also change the quit key back to it's default
at any time from the same menu.

Can I use AGS with A500 mini firmware updates?
----------------------------------------------
Yes. AGS isn't affected by firmware updates.

Why do the RTG games not fill the screen on the A500 mini?
----------------------------------------------------------
RTG scaling is broken on the standard version. They will run full screen if you
use the Pandory version of AGS which has an updated version of Amiberry but
it does run slightly slower.

On the A500 mini, can I use scanlines?
--------------------------------------
Yes. Enable them in the A500 Mini Options screen under Display options - Enable
CRT effect.

Can I use ADF files in AGS Mini?
--------------------------------
Yes. Use the Amiberry interface to add ADF files. You may need to use the
Amiberry interface to shut down the program as the menu button is disabled.

The sound runs too slow on Hippoplayer on the A500 mini. Can I fix it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Either run AGS Pandory or switch Workbench into AGA mode.

Can I safely shut down my A500 mini from AGS?
---------------------------------------------
Yes. Go to 'Options - Shut Down System' and AGS will turn off your A500 mini. Be
aware though that there is a bug in the A500 mini firmware that prevents the
power properly turning off, so you may have to unplug the USB cable.


======================
Raspberry Pi Questions
======================


Can I safely shut down my Raspberry Pi in AGS?
----------------------------------------------
Yes. Go to 'Options' - 'Shut Down System'. This will shutdown your Pi
correctly without returning you to the login prompt.

Why does AGS take a really long time to load on the Raspberry Pi?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is normally due to you running your Pi on a 4k screen. To fix the issue
add...

hdmi_enable_4kp60=1

... to the config.txt file in the boot partition of the SD card.

Can I access DietPi?
--------------------
Yes. Quit Amiberry by either using 'Quit to OS' from the launcher options or
press F12 and quit from there. You will then go to a login prompt. The user is
'root' and the password is 'dietpi'.

Can I use WIFI to connect AGS to the internet on the Raspberry Pi?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Quit to DietPi and set up your WIFI in 'dietpi-config'. AGS already has
bsdsocket.library enabled so should automatically connect to your network.

Can I use bluetooth controller on the Pi version of AGS?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Quit to dietpi and pair the controller in 'dietpi-config'. Restart Amiberry
and you will be able to pick your controller from the Input menu. To permanently
save the controller overwrite the default config in the Configurations menu.

Can I change the output resolution of the Raspberry Pi?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Quit to dietpi and use in 'dietpi-config' to set the Pi's screen resolution.
Make sure that you set workbench to a matching or lower resolution before doing
this as it may crash Amiberry.

Can I update Amiberry and dietpi?
---------------------------------
Yes. Exit to DietPi and run 'dietpi-update' to update the OS and Amiberry. You
see if there are any updates available in the text once you have logged in.

Can I restart Amiberry from the Dietpi interface?
-------------------------------------------------
Yes. Either type 'reboot' and reboot the Pi or run 'dietpi-services' and restart the
Amiberry service.
