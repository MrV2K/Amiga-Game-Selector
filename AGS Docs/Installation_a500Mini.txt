                     Welcome to Amiga Game Selector v2.6
                     ===================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
						======================
	
 ON THE A500 MINI USB SCREEN, DO *NOT* PRESS THE MENU BUTTON WHEN YOU HAVE THE
 AGS CONFIGURATION FILE SELECTED OR YOU WILL CORRUPT THE FILE. IF YOU DO, YOU 
 *WILL* BREAK AGS AND ALL YOU WILL SEE IS A KICKSTART 1.3 BOOT SCREEN. TO FIX
 THE PROBLEM YOU CAN EITHER COPY THE CONFIG FILES BACK FROM THE BACKUP FOLDER
 OR RUN THE RESTORE_CONFIGS FILE.

Requirements
============
The A500 Mini Computer, Controller & Mouse
A 3 Amp USB Power Supply
A 64GB USB Flash Drive
USB Keyboard (Recommended)


Installation
============

New Install
-----------

1. Format your USB drive as FAT32. For USB drives over 32GB you may need to use
   a third party format program like Rufus (www.rufus.ie) to format the drive
   as FAT32.
2. Open the archive and extract the three folders onto your computer and then
   copy the files on to your flash drive.

Existing Install
----------------

1. Make sure that all your data is backed up onto the SHARED drive.
2. Open the archive and extract the three folders onto your computer and then
   copy the files on to your flash drive.

Nothing changes in the SHARED drive so it can either be ignored or just copied
over. No data will be overwritten.

Folder Structure
================

USB Root
  - AGS
  - Pandory
  - THEA500


Configurations
==============  

Start AGS - The original configuration
            Same compatability
			Same speed
			No RTG Scaling
			Slow sound in RTG screens
			
Start AGS Pandory - Runs in Amiberry 5.6.1
					Similar compatability to original config
					Slightly slower
					RTG Scaling
					Correct sound in Workbench
					Internet and network access

I would suggest that you use the original config to play games as it is more
compatible. The pandory version is much better for Workbench use.
					
If you run the Pandory version of AGS and would like to go back to the original
configuration, you will need to power cycle the A500 mini.


Know issues with the Pandory version
====================================

The pandory version is about 10% slower than the normal version of AGS. This is
due to the newer version of Amiberry needing a more powerful CPU.

The screen is slightly offset by default. There is a fix in the Options that
will re-center the screen.

Most games won't fit the screen by default as Amiberry 5.6.1 uses a different
set of commands to resize the screen. You can do this manually in the Amiberry
screen on the `Display` tab.

Sometimes it will freeze during the boot cycle. Don't use the menu button to 
fix this, power cycle the A500 mini and load AGS again.

For internet access you need to have a USB to Ethernet adaptor connected
before you run the Pandory config or it will not be picked up.


Backing Up Your Save Games
==========================

1. To back up your save games, you will need to copy the 'Savegames' folder to
   your computer first. The folder is located here...
   
   (v1.0 to v1.2) - USB Drive -> THEA500 -> whdboot -> save-data -> Savegames
   (v1.3 to v1.4) - USB Drive -> SHARED -> Savegames
   (v1.5 onwards) - USB Drive -> AGS -> SHARED -> Savegames
   
2. Saves from non WHDLoad games and other programs will need to be backed up 
   onto the USB drive and then onto your computer before updating using the
   process above.
   
Backing Up Other Content
========================

1. To backup other data, copy it to the USB drive before you re-install
   AGS.
2. You will then need to copy the SHARED folder onto your computer.
   The folder is located here...  
   
   (v1.0 to v1.2) - USB Drive -> THEA500 -> whdboot -> save-data -> Transfer
   (v1.3 to v1.4) - USB Drive -> SHARED
   (v1.5 onwards) - USB Drive -> AGS -> SHARED

Restoring Your Save Games & Other Content
=========================================

1. Copy the SHARED folder on your computer back onto the USB drive
   into the AGS folder. It doesn't matter if it overwrites anything.
2. WHDLoad save games will now work but you will need to manually copy back the
   other content into the relevant folders with Directory Opus.

Backing Up Your AGS Favourites
==============================

Please note that the old favourites will work with the AGS v2.0 but may give
errors as the scripts on some games have changed. If possible, please re-create
your favourites.

1. Open the '+  Favourites' menu in AGS
2. Select [Backup Favourites]
3. Wait for the process to complete and quit AGS.
4. Back up as above as it will automatically be in the SHARED folder.

Restoring Your AGS Favourites
=============================

1. Copy the 'SHARED' folder back onto the USB Drive as above.
2. Run AGS and open the '+  Favourites' menu.
3. Select [Restore Favourites] and wait for the archive to extract.
