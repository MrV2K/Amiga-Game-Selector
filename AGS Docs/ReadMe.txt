Introduction
============

Thank you for downloading my game and demo collection.

This collection includes an archive of all the current WHDLoad games and
demos in Retroplay's collection which can be run from a convenient launcher.

All of the games and demos have all been sorted, categorized and optimized 
for each release format and they all have in-game, title and box cover
artwork.

The collection also contains an extended set of hand picked games that are
not available in the official WHDLoad collection. These extra games include 
shareware, commercial, emulated and RTG games. All the games included are
free of charge, but please do support the hard work that the developers of
these games have put in. Links for their sites are included in the game
descriptions.

NOTE: This collection is supplied completely free of charge and should never
be sold. If you have paid money for it, please demand a refund and stop
supporting the crooks selling software they haven't developed. The only
authorised paid source of AGS is from our sponsor www.retro32.com. Any money
taken is used to cover the cost of the USB drive and time taken to copy the
files. No money is paid to myself for this service.
