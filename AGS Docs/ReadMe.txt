Introduction
============

Thank you for downloading my game and demo collection.

This collection includes an archive of all the current WHDLoad games and demos 
in Retroplay's collection which can be run from a convenient launcher.

All of the games and demos have all been sorted, categorized and optimized 
for each release format and they all have in-game, title and box cover artwork.

The collection also contains an extended set of hand picked games that are not 
available in the official WHDLoad collection. These extra games include 
shareware, commercial, emulated and RTG games. All the games included are free
of charge, but please do support the hard work that the developers of these
games have put in. Links for their sites are included in the game descriptions.

NOTE: This collection is supplied completely free of charge and should never be 
sold. If you have paid money for it, please demand a refund and stop supporting 
the crooks selling software they haven't developed. The only authorised paid
source of AGS is from our sponsor www.retro32.com. Any money taken is used to
cover the cost of the USB drive and time taken to copy the files. No money is
paid to myself for this service.
